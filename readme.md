**Project Title: Streamlit Urban Mining Potential Assessment App**

**Overview**

This Streamlit application provides valuable insights for urban planners, policymakers, and businesses interested in exploring the circular economy potential within the built environment of Amsterdam. The app draws upon real-world data and interactive visualizations to:

* **Identify potential urban mining resources:** Explore material flows and the availability of reusable materials within the city.
* **Analyze scenarios and trade-offs:** Compare different development scenarios based on building types, material impact, and housing typologies.
* **Evaluate circular economy options:** Assess the potential for reuse, recycling, and repurposing of materials.
* **Generate AI-powered reports:** Obtain concise summaries of key findings, with tailored recommendations for specific stakeholders.

**Getting Started**

1. **Prerequisites**
   * Python 3.6 or later
   * Pip (package installer for Python)

2. **Installation**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/streamlit-urban-mining-app  # Replace with your repo link
   cd streamlit-urban-mining-app
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Running the App**

   ```bash
   streamlit run /Users/ivanthung/code/mock_up_umdashboard/readmeprep.py
   ```

   This will open the app in your web browser, typically at http://localhost:8501.

**Structure**

The project follows a modular structure for maintainability and clarity:

* **`/Users/ivanthung/code/mock_up_umdashboard/readmeprep.py`:**  The main entry point for the Streamlit app.
* **`/Users/ivanthung/code/mock_up_umdashboard/__init__.py`:** Empty file to indicate that the 'mock_up_umdashboard' directory is a Python package.
* **`/Users/ivanthung/code/mock_up_umdashboard/Start.py`:** Contains the code for the initial landing page of the application.
* **`/Users/ivanthung/code/mock_up_umdashboard/utils/`:**  This directory houses utility modules:
    * **`ai_report.py`:** Handles interaction with the AI model for report generation.
    * **`buildingdata.py`:** Classes and functions for managing building data.
    * **`calculations.py`:**  Performs necessary calculations for scenarios and visualizations.
    * **`reportgenerator.py`:**  Generates PDF reports from the provided data and figures.
    * **`utils.py`:** Common utilities for maps, data loading, etc.
    * **`column_configs.py`:** Specific column configurations for dataframes and visualizations used in the app.
    * **`data_manager.py`:** Loads and manages data (BAG dataset, scenarios) in the session state.
* **`/Users/ivanthung/code/mock_up_umdashboard/pages/`:** Contains individual pages of the Streamlit app:
    * **`1_1 - Sloop en transformatie.py`** :  Allows editing of demolition and transformation parameters within the BAG dataset, and provides insights on building profiles.
    * **`2_2 - Nieuwbouw.py`**: Enables the selection of building typologies for new construction scenarios.

**Data**

* **`spatial_data/final/bag-ams-zuidoost-platdak-buurt.shp`:** Sample BAG dataset (shapefile format). Replace with your comprehensive dataset.
* **`scenarios/scenario_data.pickle`:** (If applicable) Stores saved user-generated scenarios for future use.

**Features**

* **Dynamic visualizations:** Interactive charts and maps provide an engaging data exploration experience.
* **Scenario building:**  Users can create and compare different urban  development scenarios.
* **AI-generated reports:**  The app leverages an AI model (like GPT-4) to summarize findings and offer insights tailored to specific stakeholders.

**Dependencies:**

See the `requirements.txt` file for a complete list of dependencies.
